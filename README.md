| ---- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 1    | Load & preview data         | Sanity check + get quick structure |
| 2    | Basic Info & Nulls          | Look for missing data, dtypes      |

✅ Phase 0 — Project Setup & GitHub Init
Create project directory and environment (conda, Jupyter)

Initialize Git repository and push to GitHub

Set up basic folder structure and README

Save raw dataset to data/raw/

📦 Outcome: Clean setup, project versioning started, README and folders ready

🔎 Phase 1 — EDA + Initial Understanding
Load dataset, explore columns, understand datatypes

Visualize key features (distribution, correlation, outliers)

Understand missing values, class imbalance, etc.

Label encoding or quick mapping (e.g. 'Yes' → 1, 'No' → 0)

📦 Outcome: Deep understanding of the data, hypothesis ready, bad columns marked

🧹 Phase 2 — Data Preprocessing
Handle missing values (drop, impute, custom methods)

Encode categorical features (Label/One-hot/Ordinal)

Scale/normalize numerical data

Drop irrelevant/noisy features manually

Optional: PCA or dimensionality reduction for pruning

Save cleaned dataset to data/processed/

🔧 We’ll design preprocessing pipeline here and keep it reusable via src/preprocessing.py.

📦 Outcome: Cleaned, encoded, scaled dataset → ready for ML/DL

🤖 Phase 3 — ML Modeling
Train baseline models (LogReg, Decision Trees, Random Forest)

Train advanced models (SVM, XGBoost, LightGBM)

Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV)

Metric comparison: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, AUC-ROC

Save best model (joblib, pickle)

Visualize confusion matrix, ROC curves, etc.

📦 Outcome: Best ML model with evaluation results and saved weights

🧠 Phase 4 — Deep Learning (MLP)
Train a Deep Neural Net (MLP) using TensorFlow/Keras

Architecture tuning (layers, dropout, activations)

Compare with ML results

Optional: Add batch normalization, weight initialization, callbacks

Save model (.h5 or SavedModel format)

📦 Outcome: Working DNN for tabular data with metric comparison

🔍 Phase 5 — Interpretability & Explainability
Feature importance (for tree-based models)

SHAP, LIME or ELI5 for DL model explainability

Compare which features affect prediction most

📦 Outcome: Interpretability plots + explanations for final report

☁️ Phase 6 — Deployment (Optional/Bonus)
Convert notebook code to Python scripts/modules

Build simple CLI or Flask web app

Push to HuggingFace Spaces or Render (free tier)

Add usage guide in README

📦 Outcome: Minimal deployable project or API, usable by others

📘 Phase 7 — Final Docs + README Polish
Clean and complete README.md

Add model performance charts

Final cleanup, remove junk notebooks, export PDFs

📦 Outcome: Shareable GitHub project with clarity and polish
